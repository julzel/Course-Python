# Python Syntax

The syntax of a programming language refers to the rules and structure of the language. In this lesson, we'll explore the basic syntax of Python, including how to write comments, assign values to variables, and use operators.

### Comments

Comments are lines of code that are not executed by the Python interpreter, but are used to provide information about the code. Comments are useful for documenting your code and explaining what different parts of your code do.

In Python, comments start with the # symbol. Here's an example:

```python
# This is a comment
```

### Variables and Assignment

Variables are used to store data in a Python program. To assign a value to a variable, use the `=` operator. Here's an example:

```python
x = 5
```

In this example, we assign the value `5` to the variable `x`. The variable `x` now holds the value `5`, which can be used later in the program.

Python variable names must follow certain rules:

- Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot start with a number.
- Variable names are case-sensitive, so x and X are two different variables.
- Variable names should be descriptive and meaningful.

### Operators

Operators are used in Python to perform various operations on data. Here are some common operators in Python:

#### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations on numbers.

```python
+   # addition
-   # subtraction
*   # multiplication
/   # division
%   # modulo (remainder)
**  # exponentiation
```

#### Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare values and return a Boolean value (`True` or `False`).

#### Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine Boolean values and return a Boolean result.

```python
and   # logical and
or    # logical or
not   # logical not
```
