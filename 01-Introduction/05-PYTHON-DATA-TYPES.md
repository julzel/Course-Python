# Data Types

Data types are used to represent different kinds of data in a Python program. In this lesson, we'll introduce the different data types in Python, including integers, floats, strings, and booleans, and discuss how to declare and use these data types in Python programs.

The data types in Python can be classified into two main categories: simple or primitive data types and complex data types.

- **Simple or primitive data types**: These are the basic data types in Python that cannot be broken down into smaller components. They include integers, floats, strings, and booleans. These data types are immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed once they are assigned.

- **Complex data types**: These are more advanced data types in Python that can hold multiple values or other data types. They include lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. These data types are mutable, meaning that their values can be changed after they are assigned.

### Simple Data Types

The simple or primitive data types in Python include:

- [Integers](#integers)
- [Floats](#floats)
- [Strings](#strings)
- [Booleans](#booleans)

These data types are the building blocks of Python programs and are immutable, meaning that their values cannot be changed once they are assigned. In later lessons, we'll cover more complex data types in Python that can hold multiple values or other data types, including:

- Lists
- Tuples
- Sets
- Dictionaries

#### Integers

Integers are whole numbers without any decimal point. Here are some examples of integer values:

```python
x = 5
y = -10
z = 0
```

To declare an integer variable, simply assign an integer value to a variable.

#### Floats

Floats are numbers with decimal points. Here are some examples of float values:

```python
x = 3.14
y = -2.5
z = 0.0
```

To declare a float variable, simply assign a float value to a variable.

#### Strings

Strings are used to represent text in a Python program. Here are some examples of string values:

```python
x = "Hello, world!"
y = 'Python is awesome'
z = ""
```

To declare a string variable, enclose the text in either single quotes (`'`) or double quotes (`"`).

#### Booleans

Booleans are used to represent true/false values. Here are some examples of boolean values:

```python
x = True
y = False
```

To declare a boolean variable, simply assign either `True` or `False` to a variable.
