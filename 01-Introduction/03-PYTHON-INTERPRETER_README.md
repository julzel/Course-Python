# Using the Python Interpreter

The Python interpreter is a powerful tool that allows you to execute Python code directly from the command line. In this lesson, we'll explore how to use the interpreter to execute Python code, including how to open the interpreter and how to execute simple commands.

### Opening the Python Interpreter

To open the Python interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.

2. Type the command `python` or `python3` and press `Enter`.

3. The Python interpreter should open in the terminal, and you should see the Python prompt (`>>>`) displayed.

### Executing Simple Commands

Once you have opened the Python interpreter, you can start executing Python code right away. Here are some examples of simple Python commands you can execute:

##### Arithmetic Operations

```python
>>> 2 + 2
4

>>> 10 - 5
5

>>> 3 * 4
12

>>> 15 / 3
5.0
```

##### String Operations

```python
>>> "Hello, world!"
'Hello, world!'

>>> 'Hello' + ' ' + 'world!'
'Hello world!'

>>> 'spam' * 3
'spamspamspam'
```

##### Variables and Assignment

```python
>>> x = 5

>>> y = 10

>>> z = x + y

>>> print(z)
15

```

##### Functions

```python
>>> def greet(name):
...     print("Hello, " + name + "!")

>>> greet("John")
Hello, John!
```
